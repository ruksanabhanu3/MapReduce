Use Map reduce to find out the trending songs from the savnn music app data

Algorithm should take into account the recent history. Itâ€™s up to you to decide what this window should be. It may be 4 hours or even a couple of days.
Ensure that songs with random streaming patterns with sudden spikes are not labelled as trending, as these might be anomalies in the data.
Compare the output of your algorithm with Saavn's trending songs and try to improve it by possibly choosing a different window or by assigning different weights to the stream records.
